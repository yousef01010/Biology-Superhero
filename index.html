                <h1>ready to meet our bio hero !?</h1>
                <p>In the last years it was observed that there are alot of risks violating Astronnauts lives.
                    To find solutions for these risks we aimed to make space experiment on different living organisms.
                    Upon our challenge we try to collect best characteristics in any creature adaptation to space and combine them in a new creature called BioHero

                <p>to adapt (microgravity,
                    radiation, extreme temperatures, low pressure and
                    isolation)</p> 
                <p class="special-p">While living and working in space is mentally strenuous, the absence of gravity makes working in a spacecraft physically undemanding. On Earth, we must constantly use certain muscles to support ourselves against the force of gravity. These muscles, commonly called antigravity muscles, include the gastrocnemius (calf muscles), the quadriceps, and the muscles of the back and neck. Because astronauts work in a weightless (microgravity) environment, very little muscle contraction is needed to support their bodies or move around.</p>

                <p class="special-title">Space pressure:</p>
                <p class="special-p">Air pressure in space is extremely low which equals
                    approximately zero!</p>
                <p class="special-title">Gravitational force difference:</p>
                <p class="special-p">Gravity in space is extremely smaller than Earths’ as it also
                    approximately equals zero.
                    Vestibular System which plays an important role in stabilizing
                    human body turns gravitational information it gets into
                    electrical impulses and then sends it to the brain.</p>
                <p class="special-title">Radiations:</p>
                <p class="special-p">In outer space, without any atmosphere radiations are much
                    denser and have lot of impacts on human body as they can lead
                    to change heart or vessels function which will lead in turn to
                    arteriosclerosis and will damage some tissues too.
                    If neurons or neuroglials cells damages, it will be difficult to
                    heal new cells which will lead to mental weakness and
                    insufficiency of memory.</p>

                <p class="special-p">Mice adaptivity to gravitational disturbance in space:</p>
                <p> Mice have shown that they are able to adapt micro gravities in
                    space.
                    By observing mice behavior, special behavior was noticed from
                    some mice
                    The study included two categories (Earth mice &amp; space mice)
                    where the space mice showed the same results as Earth’s.
                    Unique behavior was observed from the mice after a week of
                    launch where groups of young and old female mice started
                    what scientist called (race-tracking) as they were moving as in
                    racing laps.</p>              
                <p class="special-p">Female Mice adaptivity to Galactic Cosmic Radiations:</p>
                <p> Our major obstacle for successful deep space journey is the
                    negative impact of the GCR (Galactic Cosmic Radiations) on
                    living organisms.

                    Upon exposing male and female mice to GCR it was observed
                    that males only was affected by it and females haven’t any
                    unordinary behaviors at all.
                    From those researches we claimed that females might be
                    better than males in some space missions.</p>
